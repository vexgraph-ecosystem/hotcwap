// window/window_wayland.c — the lean Wayland backend for the Window API (draft).
//
// A 1:1 mirror of the AppKit backend (window/window_cocoa.m): the same
// exported C surface, the same state families (POLICY / CONTENT / ADAPTERS),
// the same reflection words, the same WindowEvent lifecycle bridge, the same
// id registry. The only differences are the OS handle that anchors each
// window (wl_surface + xdg_toplevel instead of NSWindow) and the window-manager
// dialect that serves it (xdg-shell events instead of AppKit notifications).
//
// This is a DRAFT translation unit: it is not wired into CMake and has not
// been compiled against a real libwayland. It mirrors the Cocoa backend
// function-for-function so that wiring it in later (UNIX with WAYLAND_DISPLAY
// -> window/window_wayland.c, with window_linux.c kept as the X11 fallback)
// is a build-script edit, not an API migration.
//
// Like the Cocoa backend it is deliberately LEAN: a window with bridges, and
// nothing else. The compositor does the presentation plumbing — the wl_pointer/
// wl_keyboard/wl_touch listeners mirror OS state into C-visible words exactly
// the way the AppKit delegate notifications do, and input routes into the
// vexspoke Key/Mouse/Touch rings. There is NO Vulkan, NO swapchain and NO
// present worker here — rendering is the render repos' job and reaches the
// screen through the software present seam (a lean wl_shm path mirroring the
// retired raster present) or, once Migrates, the render repos' own surfaces.
// A Window is a dumb surface + callback bridge per the Window Decoupling Law.
//
// The GPU-era composite surface (boards, panes, worker present) is retained
// as thin INERT stubs at the bottom of this file exactly as the Cocoa backend
// keeps them, so the still-unmigrated darling compositor links. They retire
// together with their window.h declarations.

;;DEFINITION
/**
 * ============================================================================
 * DEFINITION: Window_wayland
 * ============================================================================
 * Wayland/XDG desktop window abstraction implementation mirroring Cocoa capabilities.
 * Manages wl_surface, xdg_surface, and xdg_toplevel primitives, routing Wayland
 * seat input into vexspoke device rings and dispatching surface configure events
 * through the embedded WindowEvent lifecycle handlers.
 *
 * Implements the Window Decoupling Law as a presentation surface and event
 * bridge decoupled from GPU drivers, featuring a lean wl_shm software presentation
 * seam alongside inert compatibility stubs.
 * ============================================================================

;;OVERVIEW
/**
 * ============================================================================
 * CLASS: Window (window/window_wayland.c)
 * LEVEL: L4 — Self-Management (Wayland OS window shim owned by the OS)
 * ============================================================================
 * SUMMARY:
 *   DRAFT Wayland mirror of the AppKit window backend. One opaque C handle per
 *   wl_surface + xdg_toplevel; the engine loop constructs it, configures the
 *   chrome, commits it, then pumps Window_pollEvents once per frame while a
 *   render path draws through the software present seam (wl_shm) / event
 *   bridges. OS input is routed into the vexspoke device rings (tagged with
 *   this window's id); OS lifecycle (quit, resize, fullscreen, minimize,
 *   restore, press, focus) fires the embedded WindowEvent. Zero Vulkan, zero
 *   compositing — a Window is a dumb surface + callback bridge per the Window
 *   Decoupling Law.
