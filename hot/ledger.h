// hot/ledger.h — the machine-scoped install ledger (R1 host).
//
// Records, OUTSIDE the install tree, that an application (org/app) has been
// installed on this machine — and survives UNINSTALL. Backed by the OS-native
// secure store: macOS Keychain (hot/ledger_cocoa.m). Other platforms fail
// closed until a backend is wired (Windows DPAPI, Linux Secret Service).
//
// This is a CORRECTNESS record, not a security boundary: a local user with the
// machine can always clear the store. Its promise is "the machine remembers
// this app was here", not "the machine cannot forget". The in-tree
// manifest.json stays the ownership marker for safe deletion; this ledger is
// the machine's out-of-tree memory of the install.
