## 0. Constitution Link (supreme)
- [preferences.md](https://gist.github.com/vex-graph/4132a6c45cb6d3797c3e8eff2e94035a) — real, Git-ignored workspace-root file at ../../../preferences.md, not a tracked Vexspoke file or symlink.
- All universal laws in `../../../preferences.md` are mandatory and binding across the ecosystem.
- This document codifies **exclusive** preferences for `hotcwap` (R1 Kernel Host). R2 comprises Vexspoke computation/behavior and Relational Engine memory/storage/native C search. R1 owns lifetimes/residency and must exclude active users before storage destruction. Existing Lifetime/default allocator wiring is unchanged; no direct engine-header dependency, automatic schema migration or live engine reload integration is implied.

## 1. Repo-Local Law Index (Binding Matrix)

Universal laws are inherited from the canonical `../../../preferences.md` Index; this table indexes the additional laws specific to this repository.

| Law Title | Scope | Enforcement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **One-Seam Canvas Window Architecture Law** | R1 Kernel Host | Mandatory for `hotcwap` |
| **Continuous Real-Time Live Resize & Presentation Law (Abolishing "Freeze-Exact")** | R1 Kernel Host | Mandatory for `hotcwap` |
| **Present-On-Demand Law (composite ≠ render)** | R1 Kernel Host | Mandatory for `hotcwap` |
| **Dynamic Module ABI Verification Law** | R1 Kernel Host | Mandatory for `hotcwap` |

## 2. Exclusive Repo-Local Laws (FULL PROSE RESTATEMENT)

### One-Seam Canvas Window Architecture Law

#### Definition:
The host window composite owns exactly ONE on-screen Metal layer — the seam
canvas (`CAMetalLayer`) — beneath an optional transparent `NSVisualEffectView`
blur substrate. All Vulkan-rendered boards (scene backdrop, content UI) are
retained OFFSCREEN targets composited into the seam image by the render repo
(the Window Compositing Layer Order Law + the Single-Seam Canvas Law); no
per-scene or per-widget `CALayer` and no Vulkan window presentation path.

#### The Why:
A single on-screen Metal layer keeps one frame cadence for the whole window.
Its drawable size follows the live window-content backing size, not a fixed
monitor-sized buffer. Board rectangles are resolved against that size.

#### The Rule:
1. **Bottom Layer:** window blur substrate; no UI widget owns a display layer.
2. **Top Layer:** the one seam `CAMetalLayer` (`geometryFlipped = YES`,
   TopLeft-pinned, native-pixel `drawableSize`); it is the only on-screen
   Metal layer in the window. The renderer composites retained board targets
   into its drawable; hotcwap continues to own window and event routing.

### Continuous Real-Time Live Resize & Presentation Law (Abolishing "Freeze-Exact")

Freezing the canvas extent and early-returning from layout during mouse drags (`Window_isLiveResizing`) is
**strictly abolished**. Deferring work to "settle" is an artificial cop-out
that produces frozen windows, dead animations, and visual tearing. During an
active window drag or live resize, the rendering pipeline operates
continuously:

1. **Dynamic Extent:** `CAMetalLayer.drawableSize` tracks the live
   window-content backing bounds on every resize event; retained GPU targets
   are resized without creating a Vulkan presentation object.
2. **Live Layout Recalculation = Real-Time Anchor Feel:** Container layout and
   anchor resolution run on live bounds every frame of the drag — pinned
   elements (e.g., right-anchored, bottom-anchored) recalculate their offsets
   dynamically and re-present, so they stay glued to their edges in real time.
   The resolution granularity is one vsync (60/120Hz), which IS the native
   contract: CoreAnimation itself commits per frame, so per-frame latency is
   indistinguishable from a native view. Nothing is ever stale beyond the
   latency of a single frame. The sub-frame gap between a resize event and
   the next frame is covered by the instantly-moved layer frame (the
   Single-Transaction Live Coordination Law) plus the gravity-pinned last
   bitmap — never black, never torn, never stretched-out-of-anchor.
3. **Unbroken Animation & Presentation:** Animation tickers,
   dirty-propagation, and command buffer presentation
    continue rendering and presenting at the
   display's native refresh rate (60/120Hz) throughout mouse drags and moves.

### Present-On-Demand Law (composite ≠ render)

A surface presents only on demand. Demand is change: motion, layout, text,
hover, or a scene publishing a new frame. Anything static presents once and
then rests on its last composite — the compositor never re-presents clean
content and never re-invokes a scene's render handler.

#### The Why (subsumes the former No Double-Render Law)
The old law forbade stamping one panel into two display targets. Present-on-demand
makes that impossible by construction: a scene RENDER (its world into its
retained offscreen target — `VkLayer`, own thread, own FPS) is distinct from
a COMPOSITE (sample published targets + paint the UI tree into the canvas at
vsync). The canvas painter only samples published targets — it cannot
re-render a scene. Double-render is structurally unreachable, not merely
forbidden.

#### Present modes (per scene):
- `COMPOSITED` (default): the scene owns retained flight render targets
  (offscreen images + acquire/render semaphores + fences) on its own
  timeline; the canvas samples the latest published frame at the anchor rect,
  in tree z-order interleaved with UI. One canvas total — no per-scene
   surfaces and no DIRECT mode (the Single-Seam Canvas Law).

#### Composite rules:
- The presenter wakes only on demand: a dirty tree, a published layer frame,
  or a live-resize drag (the moving edge is itself a ticket). An idle tree
  sleeps — zero presents, zero GPU work; power is the free win.
- UI paints the FULL tree on any dirty tick (immediate-on-demand; damage
  rects are a later optimization, never a first move). Static content rests:
  the canvas is neither re-acquired nor presented.
- Scene anchors are plain resolved C rects into the canvas; WindowServer-
  native anchoring (`presentsWithTransaction`, `autoresizingMask`) lives on
  the single canvas layer only.

### Dynamic Module ABI Verification Law

#### Definition:
Dynamic dylibs loaded during hot-reload passes must verify their ABI compatibility header before binding function trampolines. The loader inspects ABI version, class registry hashes, and exported symbol alignments. Retiring modules cycle through ABA-safe retirement rings.

#### The Why:
Live reloading without ABI validation causes memory misalignment and crashes when struct fields change between compilations. Validating before swapping guarantees zero runtime crashes during live iteration.

#### The Rule:
1. **Pre-Flight Verification:** ABI headers are checked before swapping function pointers.
2. **Graceful Rejection:** Incompatible dynamic modules fail cleanly, leaving the previous working version active.
