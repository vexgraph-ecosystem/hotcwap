// permission/permission.h — OS capability permission requests (R1 host).
//
// Answers "may I do X?" for the capabilities a host app must ask the operating
// system for: screen capture, global key listening, event synthesis,
// accessibility control, camera, microphone, contacts, and kin. It is the R1
// prerequisite for the screen/input automation layer (screen capture + key
// listening + accessibility control) and for any app that needs a gated
// resource.
//
// CROSS-PLATFORM CONTRACT: a PermissionKind exists on every host; where the
// host has no such concept the status is PERMISSION_UNSUPPORTED. A kind is
// NEVER silently reported as granted.
//
// THE ASYNC + RESTART TRUTH (macOS): a request raises a prompt and the answer
// arrives LATER, so callers poll Permission_status in bounded slices (the
// Bounded Wait Law). Some grants (screen capture) only bind after the process
// RELAUNCHES — Permission_requiresRestart reports which. This class NEVER
// relaunches, exits, or re-execs the process: the user restarts on their own
// time, so the hotcwap hot-reload experience is never violated.
//
// THREAD CONTRACT: thread 0 only (the request calls touch OS UI).
